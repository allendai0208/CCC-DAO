# CCC-DAO

This is a DAO proposal whitepaper I created with Catherine Yu, Jenny Sheng, and Kwan Sirisakunngam for COS495 during our 2022 Spring semeseter at Princeton University. Our DAO is called CCC, which stands for Creator-Centric Communities. As the name suggests, our DAO aims to create a platform that supports interactions between content creators and their fans, revolving around creator tokens. In this proposal we discuss the structure, governance, tokenomics, and operations of the DAO.
